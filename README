25 years ago, I wrote a VT102 terminal emulator, which I published on
sourceforge. I recently needed one, and to my amazement, it was still
available in a crusty old read-only CVS repository. For further 
preservation, I'm reuploading it here. Additionally, I am changing the
licensing terms to Apache 2.0, which overrides the terms stated in the
original README below.


GTERM v. 1.0

Copyright 1999, Timothy Miller
tim@techsource.com

This is the first release version of GTerm.  I intend to further clean
up the code in the future, and I will incorporate changes suggested by
others.  I expect to add additional functionality to both the core and the
X11 example in the future.

Old licensing terms of this software were as follows (basically GPL):

- You may distribute this source code, unmodified, to others, with 
  documentation.
- You may modify it for your own use and distribute the modified version,
  with documentation, as long as it is clearly indicated who the original 
  author is (Timothy Miller).
- You may not distribute this software in its original or modified form
  without also making the source code available for free.

New licensing terms put the Core and Utility sections under LGPL and the
X11 example under GPL.


GTerm is an abstract terminal emulator core.  It knows how to process VT100
VT102, and VT52 codes and format output properly for display.  But it does
not know how to acquire input or physically display output.  You must supply 
that functionality.  An example of that functionality is provided.  This 
system is written in C++.

The GTerm core:

Makefile	Makefile to compile GTerm and XTerm example
gterm.hpp	Header for all other GTerm files
gterm.cpp	High-level terminal functions
states.cpp	State machine tables for emulator
vt52_states.cpp	State machine tables for VT52 mode
actions.cpp	Operations controlled by state machine
utils.cpp	Utility functions used by actions


Utility:

pseudo*.cpp	Linux pseudoterminal functions


The X11 example which uses GTerm:

xintfc.hpp	Header for XTerm
xintfc.cpp	X11 functionality for XTerm
xkeys.cpp	X11 key translation tables

Other documentation

gterm.doc	Explanation of the use of the GTerm core
xintfc.doc	Some information about the X11 example

The resulting executable of the build should be made suid root for best
functionality.
